# 💌 Goodnight LoveBot

An App I decided to write as soon as my girlfriend said that she doesn't mind automation as long as she gets her nightly loving message. So I set off to do this. I decided it needs the following features to dictate its functionality. 

It needs to know how I feel, to determine what sort of message it will send, and if I provide context it will use ChatGPT to write an appropriate message. If it does not receive input regarding my mood it should still send a standard message, because who is the robot to miss a message?!

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Mood tracking: Select your mood and optionally leave a note about your day or thoughts for her.
- 💬 Automatic messaging: A sweet goodnight WhatsApp message gets sent each night.
- 🎭 Interface variety: I just wanted to live it up in the terminal, so I get to choose between a **classic UI** or a **terminal-style experience**.
- 🐳 Fully Dockerized: Easy to run anywhere, no local Python setup required.
- 💬 Twilio + WhatsApp Business API integration.
